      <b>Abstract.</b>  
        Low-end earphones are widely spread due to their affordability, but their limited speaker hardware often leads to poor music playback quality. This raises a key question: Can we compensate for hardware limitations to enhance the listening experience without modifying the device? Existing EQ-based approaches attempt this, but they rely on frequency response curves (FRCs) measured under ideal conditions, which fail to capture real-world distortions such as harmonic and intermodulation effects.
        To address this, we propose Cheap2Chic, a two-stage, speaker-aware framework that improves music playback quality on low-end earphones using deep learning. In stage one, Cheap2Chic trains a speaker characterization model to capture the playback properties of the target earphone. In stage two, it introduces a digital audio enhancement model, prepended before the frozen speaker characterization model, that learns to adapt the input audio to compensate for hardware-induced distortions. To reduce the data collection burden required for accurate speaker characterization, Cheap2Chic also incorporates a data synthesis module. We built a prototype and collected a dataset to evaluate Cheap2Chic under diverse real-world conditions. Results show that Cheap2Chic significantly improves perceived music quality both objectively and subjectively, while remaining efficient on mobile devices.
